# Veegil banking app

This project was built by me Waris Oloyede in accordance to the veegil fullstack developer assessment

This is a full-stack fictious banking application which was built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB (Back-end) and React.js (Front-end)

I am very proud to announce that i built this application (API and front-end) alone with the listed tools above, it was really a stressful work but with dedication and passion, i was able to build something
I intentionally used pure CSS (without UI library like material UI) so as to show my CSS skill and level for this position
I tried my best to document every code i write in the api so other people can easily understand the work

### [Live Demo](https://veegil-banking-app.herokuapp.com/ "Veegil banking app")
